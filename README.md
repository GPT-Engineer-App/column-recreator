Recreate the webpage seen on the image. It has 5 columns that you need to recreate. The last col. is called ACtion with clickable icons that have no action right now. You must keep the order of icons the same.

Another col. is called Status. This col can have 3 statuses Empfangen, Kontiert and gebucht. If they are empfangen or gebucht then they must have a action required tag next to it as well adn they must show the action required icon. Rows who don't have this state must not show the action required icon.
